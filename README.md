This Currency Converter is a simple and user-friendly web application that allows users to convert one currency into another in real time. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to provide a clean and responsive user interface.

The converter fetches live exchange rates from a public currency API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date conversions. Users can easily select the source and target currencies, enter the amount, and instantly view the converted value.

This project is designed to demonstrate core web development skills such as API integration, DOM manipulation, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch & async/await), and responsive design using Bootstrap. It is suitable for beginners and serves as a practical example of how real-world web applications work.
